</center>

### Our goal for this assignment was to revamp our previous portfolio! I added visuals, animations, and different . From the original project, I updated my portfolio, added a home page, and updated the backgrounds to look more aesthetically pleasing.

<br>


My first step for this project was to decide what funtionalities I wanted to add to amp up this project. I decided I wanted to add in animations to make the page more creative and dynamic. 

<br>



## Criteria:

Within this project, I included:

<center>

```
1. Responsive web page
2. Resume, Linkedin, Github and Email
3. Aesthetic web layout
4. Linked icon and pages

 ```

</center>

<u>

## Issues with the project:

</u>

<br>

- I had issues with the responsiveness of a couple of the pages and images. 

    -  I solved this issue by using responsive containers and cards, and a media query for my About Me page to shrink the image down to a size that would fit a mobile screen:
